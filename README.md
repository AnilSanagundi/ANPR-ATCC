Author: Anil S — RV University
🚗 1️⃣ Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System
📌 Project Overview

The ANPR system automatically detects and recognizes vehicle number plates from images or videos.
It leverages OpenCV for preprocessing and OCR for text extraction, generating structured and exportable results.

🎯 Key Features

🔍 Automatic plate detection using contour & thresholding

🔠 OCR-based text recognition

🖥️ Streamlit dashboard visualization

📂 Batch processing of images/videos

📄 CSV export of recognized number plates

🖼️ Optional bounding-box visualization

🚦 2️⃣ Automatic Traffic Counting & Classification (ATCC) System
Using YOLOv8 + Streamlit Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

The ATCC system uses YOLOv8 for detection and classification of vehicles in video streams.
It tracks each vehicle, logs counts, and provides an interactive analytics dashboard.

🎯 Key Features
🧠 YOLOv8 Detection

Detects vehicle classes including:

Car

Truck

Bus

Motorbike

Bicycle

Annotated detection frames are saved for verification.

🛰️ Vehicle Tracking

Unique Track ID per vehicle

Tracks movement across frames

Records speed & direction (optional)

📊 Streamlit Dashboard

Interactive dashboard showing:

Vehicle class distribution (Bar chart)

Vehicle count over time (Line graph)

Centroid movement (Scatter plot)

Frame-by-frame detection table
