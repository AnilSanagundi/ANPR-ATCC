# 🚗 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System
### **Author: Anil S — RV University**

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
The ANPR system automatically detects and recognizes vehicle number plates in images and videos.  
It uses **OpenCV** for preprocessing and **OCR** for text recognition, generating structured data outputs.

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**
- Vehicle number plate detection
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Streamlit dashboard for viewing results
- CSV output of recognized plates
- Batch processing of multiple images/videos
- Optional visualization of detected plates

# 🚦 Automatic Traffic Counting & Classification (ATCC) System  
### **Using YOLOv8 + Streamlit Dashboard**  
### **Author: Anil S — RV University**

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project implements an **Automatic Traffic Counting & Classification (ATCC)** system using **YOLOv8**.  
It processes video streams, detects vehicles, tracks them, and generates analytical reports with a **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**
### **YOLOv8-Based Detection**
- Detects vehicles such as:
  - Car  
  - Bus  
  - Truck  
  - Motorbike  
  - Bicycle  
- Saves detection-annotated frames for verification.

### **Vehicle Tracking**
- Assigns a unique Track ID to each vehicle.
- Tracks movement frame-by-frame.

### **Streamlit Dashboard**
- Interactive analytics dashboard showing:
  - 📊 Vehicle class distribution (Bar chart)
  - 📈 Vehicle count over time (Line chart)
  - 🔵 Centroid movement across frames (Scatter plot)
  - 📝 Detailed frame-by-frame table
- Displays **sample detection images** from `outputs/images/`.
